# coding-exercises
Interview-esque coding exercises. The kind of thing where we're focused on micro-optimizations and probably bypassing questions of "is this already built into the language" or "should we even build this feature or not". :)

As time permits I plan on taking what I've done here and implementing these exercises in Scala, Clojure and Elixir, as an opportunity to play with those languages more.
